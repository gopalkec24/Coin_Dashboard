LEVEL 0 DEVOPS
Training

Why DEVOPS is required
how DEVOPS is defined
key concepts
industry analyst say about devops

Challenges facing business and IT
Agility
Time to market
Quality

Ensure the quality , splint or Iteration how it is ensure 
Cost
Reduce the cost in SDLC 

Automation
Manuall error is reduced Manuall error is reduced 
Hiow automatation is insured and reduce the work effort

DEVOPS-
stability of

Goal - Very high quality delivery in quick time
features should have customer ask for , high level quality with comparator 

Features with Quick time


dev/test/qa interaction problem
challenges faced 

Developers 
  Need infra   2-8 weeks
  
  developes -> release Manager -> <<< deployment request >>- > Deploy on the Environments
  
  QA-> release Manager -> <<deployment request>> -> QA enivirnment
  
  
  Manual handoff 
  jira
No coolarbiration
Disintgerate tools & procees
Limited Automation
Delayed Time to production

  
  
  Issues with pre Devops processes
  
  
  DEv environment works, but not in production,QA etc
  
  No collaboration .
  Production log data time constraints is involved
  Every body is either own goals
  Requirement 
  Tools are different at different level
  
  
  Quick as possible
  Deliver
  Stability
  No outage/production issue. 
  Checklist to be followed
  
  So much is effort involved in deliver to Production
  Different processes
  
  DEV & QA
  
  Dev-ops is collaboration between Dev and ops team members
  is Mind set
  it is set philosophies that emphasis on   Team culture 
  LEan PRocesses
  Automation
  product focus
  
  Every role in company to work in company
  
  collective they work in DEV ops worlds.
  
  people transformation(Culture,collaboration,communication,one team)
  one team and One goals
  transparency in communication 
  Culture of organization has to be changed
  process transformation
  LEan processes,Continuous feed back, continuous improvement)
  
  Tools and technology transformation(automation)
  Product focus
  Fail Fast,Experimentation,MVP )
  
  
  Dev ops philosophies
  
  People transformation
  Break the walks
   common goals
    
	QA is first class citizen
	Testing :Functional and  non Functional 
	
	APplication functionality and features
	what is required to delivered
	
	Experimentation
	skilled people in team
