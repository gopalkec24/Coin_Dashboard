scenario , When maximum retry count is reached, 
//incase low count is more or equal than high count ,there is two opinion that
									// 1.Consider that Triggered price is best price in maximum retry process in current loop and place a BUY order with Triggered Price
									//2. Look another best low price , with help of retry loop Count .
									  //compare the retry loop count with maximum allowable loop
										// a if it is less,Reinitialize count alone , not the price. Let triggered price remains same and wait.
										//b. if it is more , Place a BUY order with Triggered Price.
									
									
									//incase high count is more than low count, there is a opinion that
									//triggered price is maximum low price got in maximum retry process in current loop
									//and also there is chance that Market is moving towards upwards.
									//Price increase may occur
									//Now we have two options here,
									//1. Place BUY ORDER for triggered Price 
									//2. Take average of last prices and compare with triggered price.
									//		 If percentage differs between them is very less than permissible limit. 
													then place a BUY order with triggered price .
									// 		 	If Percentage differs between them is more than permissible limit, 
												//Here we have 2 options 
														//a. Place a BUY order with average Price. if difference between 
														//b. Reinitialize count alone , not the price. Let triggered price remains same and wait.
																modified : Reinitialize entrie with avg price and wait for same time maximum retry
														
 Based on above analysis 
		1. option One (1) as BASIC mode of operation
		2. Option Two (2) as ADVANCED mode of operation.
		
		by default operation mode is BASIC. it is specific to Individual transaction details.
		For advanced mode , user has to explicit specify in transaction trade data config
