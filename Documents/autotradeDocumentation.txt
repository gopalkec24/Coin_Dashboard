scenario , When maximum retry count is reached, 
//incase low count is more or equal than high count ,there is two opinion that
									// 1.Consider that Triggered price is best price in maximum retry process in current loop and place a BUY order with Triggered Price
									//2. Look another best low price , with help of retry loop Count .
									  //compare the retry loop count with maximum allowable loop
										// a if it is less,Reinitialize count alone , not the price. Let triggered price remains same and wait.
										//b. if it is more , Place a BUY order with Triggered Price.
									
									
									//incase high count is more than low count, there is a opinion that
									//triggered price is maximum low price got in maximum retry process in current loop
									//and also there is chance that Market is moving towards upwards.
									//Price increase may occur
									//Now we have two options here,
									//1. Place BUY ORDER for triggered Price 
									//2. Take average of last prices and compare with triggered price.
									//		 If percentage differs between them is very less than permissible limit. 
													then place a BUY order with triggered price .
									// 		 	If Percentage differs between them is more than permissible limit, 
												//Here we have 2 options 
														//a. Place a BUY order with average Price. if difference between 
														//b. Reinitialize count alone , not the price. Let triggered price remains same and wait.
																modified : Reinitialize entrie with avg price and wait for same time maximum retry
														
 Based on above analysis 
		1. option One (1) as BASIC mode of operation
		2. Option Two (2) as ADVANCED mode of operation.
		
		by default operation mode is BASIC. it is specific to Individual transaction details.
		For advanced mode , user has to explicit specify in transaction trade data config
		
		
		
		
		
		once order is placed the trigger_event will be 2,
		
		check for order executed or not 
			for 98% percentage , I will not be executed, so check for status
			
			if executed completely , then 
				
				1) ok good, get the details of order executed .
				based on type of profit. calculate the quantity/volume  
					a) place the entry for profit/loss for dashboard(existing and new)
					b)calculate the quantity to sold/ bought
				   c)place new Autotrade data with parent id/relationid/reference_id(yet to be finalized) to calculate the profit loss
				   d) change the status of trigger event to other value probably 3 (completed state)
				   e) New order should be properties parent order
						like PlaceAvgPriceOrder
							mode of execution if present, else default as Basic mode
							
		    else if order executed partially,
					wait for order to completed
			else if order executed is new /active / not yet executed
					options A:	wait for order to execute completely
					Options B:	check for last price  and order triggered price differs 
									if differs is between 0.0 to 0.25 %(make this value as configurable) ,
									then
										A)cancel the order and 
										B)change the 
										1)trigger_event value to 0, 
										2 )retrigger count value = Maximum retrigger count -1
										3) initialize the low,high,wait count to zero
										4)change the order triggered price as -1
										5) change the trigger price as 
											MAXIMUM_SELL_PERMISSIBLE_LIMIT differs more for sell order
											MAXIMUM BUY_PERMISSIBLE LIMIT less for buy order
									else
										wait for order to execute.	
										
		Type of profit : 1)TAKE_AMOUNT means buy volume and sell volume should be same. 
						 volume of the coin should be same as like previous transaction.	
						 for ex : we have bought 0.04 ETH for 1000 MXN : total transaction amount should be 40 MXN.
						 then while selling coin for ETH for 2000 MXN. Total volume is considered from previous transaction. volume taken for transaction is 
						 0.04 ETH. Total transaction amount is 80 MXN.
								here next transaction we need to take the volume as previous transaction volume/quantity.
								40 MXN will be profit .
								
								cummalate the tranaction currency as Profit
								
						2) KEEP_VOLUME means Transaction amt should be same for both BUY and SELL. 
						calcuate the volume of the coin based on previous transaction amount.
						   for ex: we have bought 0.04 ETH for 1000 MXN : total amount should be 40 MXN,
						   then while selling coin for  ETH for 2000 MXN : total coin take for sell should be 0.02 ETH. therefore keeping the transaction
						   amount as 40 MXN
						   Viceversa for SELL => BUY transaction
						   
						   cummulate the volume as profit
						   
						   
		1.Buy transaction held with BTC 0.04 volume orderID: from exchange (24112018) correlation Id: null
