To enable the Machine  LEarning , needs one noede to have machine lerarning feature enabled in the cluster

xonfiguration Value :
xpack.ml.enabled  => true

Elastic stack Secuirty Features  has roles and Privileges =? To cintrol the user which they can manage or View MAchine learning objects like jobsmdatafeeds,results and Model snapshots,

read manage and index privileges on destination index

Note : Cannot limit access to specifc MAchine Learning objects in each space.

Machine learing feature is visbile in your soace and (read or all) kibana privileges  for features then , access to all machine learning objects in space.

MAchine learning api usage requires index privileges as like Full or read ACcess to ML and  (machine_learning_admin or machine_learning_user) role.
