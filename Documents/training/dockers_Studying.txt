Dockers

Facing issues before Dockers

Why we need Dockers

Industry problems

product is working in DEV,but not in PROD

Micro services: 
larger application into smaller services

small processes with each other over network

ACcount service
Product catalog
CartServer
Order server

Benefit of micro services

1. Applications are easy to build when broken into smaller piece
2. easier upgrade the one particular module in application
3. Any of the Service is one down , whole application is largely unaffected .

Problems

Host machine
Multiple VM for multiple micro services

Lot of resources are used , means resources not completely used  by services .


Multiple Docker containers - Light weight alternative of  Virtual Machine(VM)
 No RAM and space is required
Virtual MAchine - 
Host MAchine - Dockers containers runs on Unix and Linux Hosted machine
RAM , Hard disk
64 GB , 20 TB
20 GB, 200 GB  virtual Machine runs  Docker containers

Dockers:

Containers are developed by developer
Through out whole SDLC process.

Container 1 Container 2
App1		App2

Docker Engine
Host OS 


Docker file -> Docker image -> Docker Hub  
				Dockers container is running instance of Docker image
				

Docker Hub -Git Repository for Docker image . Public and private repo. upload the image to repo.

Develop same environment -> through SDLC

Cloud based service provided by Docker.

JEnkins Server

Complex requirements for micro-service are written in easy to write the docker file

custom script to deploy the application in  Various VM
Environment teas 



Monolithic architecture


Docker Data center

Docker Registry
storage component for Docker images

hub.docker,com
Create repository
Explore Repositories


Docker images : Read only Template used to create Containers
containers : Built from one or More Images


sudo apt -get update
clear
sudo apt-get install lin

Docker compose


Virtualization vs Containerization

Virtualization : Guest OS on host os

disadvantge:
Mutliple VM leats to unstable performance
Long Bootuo process

Virtualization : abstraction to hardware

containerization : abstatction to software

What is Docker:
packages ur application and adll it sdependencues togther in the form if contauiners

number of system can be scaledd

size space is 
startup
Integration

16gb 3 vm
to ram
6 GB RAM 4
4 GB RAM 3
6 GB RAM 2

VM is tied to RAM

Docker uses such much as required

Startup

Integration:
jenkins Multiple instamce
puppet

Muliple instance s Integration

How Dockers works

Docker Daemon - Docker Client

Rest API

cli comands

Docker Toolbox component on IOS system/Windows

DockerHost 

Rest API,socket.IO and TCP : Remote request

Docker Images and Containers
Images : Template
Containers : Instance of images

Docker Regisrtry
Public/private repostiories
cloud reoistoru


Docker ARchitecture

Docker DaemonImages and cintainers

build images to registry 


To Pull image from Docker hub
docker pull <image-name:tag>

tag is version of the image

To run the image 
docker run <image-name:tag> or docker run <image-id>

To list down all the images in our system
docker images

to list down all the running containers
docker ps

all the containers
docker ps -a 

Build images


Creating Dockerfile

FROM
RUN

DockerFile

FROM ubuntu

RUN

ccurl
jaba
Tomcat

EXPOSE 8080


ENV JABA_OPTS

WORKDIR


docker build edu:1.0 .

To docker the start and stop

docker start <containerID>
docker stop <comtainerID>

To docker the run 
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name "bars" edu:10

docker run 

P is default port

To remove the containers
docker rm <cottaineer name<

docker rmi <image-id>
docker rmi <image:tag>
